## Loading and preprocessing the data
Dplyr is used.
```{r, echo=FALSE}
setwd("C:/Users/Simon/Google Drive/R/coursera/reproducible research/RepData_PeerAssessment1")
unzip("activity.zip")
activity <- read.csv("activity.csv")
library(dplyr)
```


## What is mean total number of steps taken per day?

total steps per day
```{r, echo=FALSE}
activity %>% 
        group_by(date) %>% 
        summarize(total=sum(steps)) %>% 
        print
```
Make histogram of total steps per day
# Have not finished!
```{r, echo=FALSE}

```

Mean and median per day
```{r, echo=FALSE}
activity %>% 
        group_by(date) %>% 
        summarize(mean=mean(steps, na.rm=TRUE), median=median(steps, na.rm=TRUE)) %>% 
        print
```


## What is the average daily activity pattern?



## Imputing missing values
